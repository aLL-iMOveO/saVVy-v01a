# saVVy-v01a
saVVy follows the 41 steps of the All-i framework, a complete conceptual model of an advanced aerospace vehicle such as an EVTOL, CAV, multicopter, E-Thrust, or Blended Wing Body (BWB) can be designed and deployed onto the market from a 2D sketch. 

This Python code will utilize the All-i framework to create a conceptual model of the Savvy Chapter API  features advance aerospace vehicle which are linked to feature product branch API s  communicated through product  branch APIs  fetaured  on Github  pluuged into  open source platform, eanbled to design CAV, BWB, EVTOL, E-Thrust ,  Mullticopters, all are linked  and empopwered by  saVVy ,  on a Tensor Flow model from a 2D sketch, leveraging advanced technology and robotics. The All-i framework offers a reliable platform for the fast development, automated products testing and validation, optimization feedback loops, and machine learning algorithms that generate insights for decision making. 

The Python code written here uses Tensor Flow to create a model that can feature saVVY advanced aerospace concept design model. The code first breaks down user inputs into individual features that are then converted into input vectors, which are processed by a Savvy Chapter API via a tf.keras.Sequential model. Autopilot is used to automate the pre-processing, normalizing, batching, and training of the model. The model is validated and iterated on, and linked to a main CNN model. A 2D sketch feature is added to the model, followed by updating the model and compiling it. The model is evaluated and used to design advanced vehicles, and its performance is monitored and updated throughout the process. Finally, the saVVy Tensor Flow Model is finalized once the model is trained and optimized.

The input to the Python code to design saVVy on Tensor Flow model is a set of user inputs, which can be numerical, text, or image data. The user inputs will be broken down into individual features to be converted into input vectors that will then be processed by a Savvy Chapter API via a tf.keras.Sequential model.

The output of this Python code is a saVVy Tensor Flow model that can be used to evaluate and design advanced aerospace vehicle concepts. The model is composed of various layers of neurons interconnected through weights, with the weights determined by a process of training and optimization.
